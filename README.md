Pac-Squad a pac-man adaptation to an iconic game!

This game is going to be an adaption of a all time classic. Pac man.
I am wanting to add an element to the game that essentially puts each level on a 3D cube.
The cube would rotate the map in a way to where the Pac Team could maneuver or 'dodge' by slipping into another dimension of the current map. They would be similar patterns but distorted colors and shapes that would be unique to each dimension on the cube. 

I have always wanted a more complex system of rules for pac-man and now with the things I have learned I am able to create theses things from scratch. Thankfully I live in a time where nothing is 100% 'From Scratch' but nonetheless it is pieced together in a unique way that brings a much more complicated mechanism to the design and gameplay of this iconic video game. 

The skeleton of the game I am using from credited in the link above and the code will be included below. 


Happy editing! Please send me your creations; I may put level packs together for
the best ones I see and distribute them with the game.
[I will be taking a personal initiative in reaching out to the original creator as to append to their work.]
